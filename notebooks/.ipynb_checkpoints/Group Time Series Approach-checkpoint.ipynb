    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a grouped time series data. It has attributes of interest or categories that further divides the data into subcategories. For example, there are 3 product sizes - small, large and extra large. \n",
    "Each of these attributes are not related to each other or have some heirarchy between themselves. Hence, it is not a hierarchical time series but rather grouped time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Grouped Time Series Categories](../artifacts/Groups.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the approach which we are going to use is applicable for both hierarchical and grouped time series data. These method take into account the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Grouped Time Series](../artifacts/GroupedTimeseries.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Sourcing Cost** = Sourcing cost of NTM1 + Sourcing cost of NTM2 + Sourcing cost of NTM3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sourcing cost of NTM1** = Sourcing cost of Manufacturer 1 (NTM1_X1) + Sourcing cost of Manufacturer 2 (NTM1_X2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sourcing cost of specific manufacturer NTM1_X1** = Sourcing cost for Direct (NTM1_X1_DIRECT) + Sourcing cost for Retail (NTM1_X1_RETAIL) + Sourcing cost for Ecom (NTM1_X1_ECOM)+ Sourcing cost for Wholesale (NTM1_X1_WHOLESALE)\n",
    "\n",
    "And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually there are 3 approaches:\n",
    "1. **Top Down** - We fit the time series at root level. Then we percolate the value downwards according to past proportions. The proportions can be forecasted too.\n",
    "2. **Bottom Up** - We fit the time series at leaf level. This is more accurate for lower levels but requires training a lot of models.\n",
    "3. **Middle Out** - We fit the time series to the middle level in heirarchy and accordiingly percolate the values up and down. This approach works great for hierarchical time series which we don't have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem with this Method\n",
    "I was invested in this method but found the problem at the end. In my modelling assumption, we had to predict the Sourcing cost of the product for whole month. However, after predicting on the test data with Bottom Up Approach, I realised that we have to predict sales for a day in month. So, my whole assumption wen't wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I instead replaced the sum with mean and got poor RMSE. Some of the data has zero demand for some months which frames this problem as **Intermittent Demand Analysis**. As we know that the mean is affected by outliers which might have caused the poor results."
